Sudoku Poject - This project uses Python to solve a Sudoku puzzle. The program finds each empty space on the Sudoku board for the user to input a number to see if it is valid or not. The puzzle is solved once all spaces are filled with valid numbers. If no numbers are valid in a box, then the puzzle is unsolvable.
